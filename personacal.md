This is a small project I did in my spare time to make a calendar for the HP Touchpad that looks a bit like the one shown in Persona 4.

You can tap the screen to get more information on the weather - high/low temperatures and the description. (Sorry, Celsius only for now.)

From this screen, you can also press the 'Settings' button to change the location the weather is given for.
