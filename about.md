Hi! I'm Gerard Martin, a software developer currently based in Cambridge, UK.

I mainly work on Ruby on Rails websites, but also have experience in iOS development and other technological bits and pieces.

I take a keen interest in anime, and am also interested in video games and music.

You can find some of my code on [Github](https://github.com/gerjomarty), and you can get in touch and keep up to date with my ramblings on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gerjomarty).
