Freshly reviewed, my app Persona Calendar is now available on the HP App Catalog for your WebOS-running HP TouchPad, made especially for the Exhibition mode. (I realise this is probably targeting a very small subset of people.)

Click [here](http://developer.palm.com/appredirect/?packageid=uk.me.gm.personacal&applicationid=1005684) from your TouchPad to view the app on the App Catalog.

More info is available from the dedicated page here: https://gm.me.uk/personacal

Feel free to tweet me with suggestions or bugs.

Thanks!
