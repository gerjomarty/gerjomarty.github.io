From the first episode, I thought that *Kuragehime* was going to be a good anime. What I didn't realise was also how annoying it was going to be. Despite this, I thought episode two was good at laying more groundwork of the story.

First of all, the sisterhood's interactions and their daily life really makes the whole thing seem genuine. While a house full of female nerds isn't the most farfetched idea in the world, it still takes some set up to make it believable. Which I think they've done very well. They all take an interest in each others likes too, which is nice. Their strangeness is also well presented when Kuranosuke drops in to their weekly hot pot party.

Which leads nicely on to annoyance number one. It's him. I lost count of the number of times Tsukimi told him to "leave", "get out" and/or "please don't come back". The point was made sufficiently and impressively clear over two days by someone who is self-professedly bad around men. And yet, he smiles, nicely asks why, and proceeds to not listen. Either he's mentally retarded, or he knows exactly what he's doing and has a larger plan (probably, and hopefully, the latter from Tsukimi's deductions). Either way, he's still an arsehole who either can't or won't respect other people's wishes. Made even clearer by the manipulative power he has over his brother.

And while I'm on the topic of annoyances, the sisterhood doesn't escape either. Fair enough, Kuranosuke did just barge in on their party, so I'm not surprised they're giving him the cold shoulder. But you can't even put their complete lack of social skills down to androphobia, because they still haven't realised he's a guy yet! As far as they're concerned, she's some female hipster, and that's damn well enough to kick her out. While the Sisterhood does get teased unfairly by others in general, they're just as bad as one of the "hipsters" they assume their unwelcome guest is. However, it's immediately clear that this is a clash of two worlds that don't understand each other.

Hmm. After rereading, it seems I've been spurred on to annoyance. Maybe this show is genuinely good after all.

I talked a bit about the opening song by chatmonchy last time, so it's only fair the ending song gets a bit of love too - it certainly deserves it. It's called "Kimi ni Kirei no Kizuite Okure" (translated, "Realize How Beautiful You Are") by Sambomaster, a three-piece rock band who've also done some music for *Bleach*. Much like chatmonchy, Sambomaster seem to have a signature sound, mostly defined by Takashi Yamaguchi's tendency to sing from the throat. That guy really loves his screaming notes - you can't get through a line of the song without them. Despite this, I thought it was quite memorable, which is usually a feat compared to other anime ending song fayre.

Finally, as predicted, Funimation just announced they've licenced this as *Princess Jellyfish*, which is nice. That of course means that it's now available legally to stream in North America from [their website](http://www.funimation.com/video) and [Youtube channel](http://www.youtube.com/show/princessjellyfish). For the rest of us, the usual channels are still open.
