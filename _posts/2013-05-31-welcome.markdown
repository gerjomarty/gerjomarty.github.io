Hello world!

This is the first of hopefully many more wonderous blog posts that’ll have you
simultaneously awestruck and in fits of boundless laughter. Or more likely
you’ll stumble across it one day Googling for a fix to a stupid problem. I
hope it’ll be good enough for the latter, at least.

My name is Gerard. I write Ruby on Rails and iOS apps for the day job, and
mostly mess around with those and other myriad technologies when the sun goes
down too.

I tweet as [@gerjomarty](http://twitter.com/gerjomarty), though it’s mostly
about anime with a light spattering of everything else. I also have a (now
mostly disused) anime blog called [Anientity](http://www.anientity.co.uk).
