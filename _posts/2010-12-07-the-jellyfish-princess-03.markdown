So I'm having some difficulty with Kuranosuke at the moment. On the one hand, he is someone who sees the good in others, even when they might act a little outside of society's rules. He certainly doesn't judge on first look. These are all good points about his varied and flamboyant character. Oh, and he's a giant dick.

Yep, truly. Let's take a look at his actions, shall we? From what we know so far, Kuranosuke's been cross-dressing to shift responsibility away from himself and on to his brother, who seems to be wrapped around his little finger. Sure, perhaps the responsibility of the family "business" is a little great, but I don't think he's dealing with it in the best way. Being a hipster, he has other hipster friends, but look - he seems to have been ignoring them recently, even going as far as telling one of them, over the phone...

I'm not going to say that he's completely at fault, given how the caller in question wasn't exactly selfless about her reasons for phoning, but even at that, it seems a little harsh to throw out all of your friends.

Not to mention his constant intrusions at the Nunnery. The girls seem to have accepted the fact that he's going to keep doing this, yet still he persists. Despite this, the culture clash that inevitably happens every time he's there is always fun and exciting to watch, especially his interactions with Tsukimi.

And on Tsukimi, she seems to be setting herself up for a fall awfully early. I think we know that this will *probably* end in tears sooner or later, but I'm hoping that *Kuragehime* puts a better spin on the unrequited love trope. It certainly seems the type of show that could do that.

The redevelopment plans certainly sound foreboding, though it sets up an interesting dynamic with Kuranosuke at the centre of everything. It just might be a chance to redeem himself.

Princess Jellyfish *is available to stream in North America on Funimation's [video site](http://www.funimation.com/video) and [Youtube channel](http://www.youtube.com/show/princessjellyfish). Fansubs available from the usual channels for everyone else.*
