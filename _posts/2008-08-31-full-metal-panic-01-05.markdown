Due to my relative lateness to the anime party compared to many of my fellow fans, there are some critically acclaimed series that I haven't seen at all. This means that I probably won't be focusing on newer stuff for the time being (until October, to be precise). This also gives me the perfect excuse to drop Strike Witches, because I don't feel that it's going to be as deep as I hoped it would be. I'm pretty sure I'm going to run out of things to say about pantsu, so I'm not going to try.

I may keep watching it though, y'know... just to see if it gets any better. Yeah... That's my reason and I'm sticking to it. >_>

Moving on, Full Metal Panic! was pretty high up the list of anime to watch, so I've decided to do a bit of blogging on it, and on my first impressions of the series so far.

We have a great comedy trio here of Sousuke, Kurz and Melissa. They play off each other well, with Melissa being the iron lady, Kurz being the lovable comedian and Sousuke being the blank, expressionless one that everyone tries to get a reaction out of.

Then, of course, Sousuke has to get himself into some hilarioud capers at school with his military attitude. Honestly, I'm surprised his teacher didn't catch on when she stopped him going into school with a gun. A *gun*, in *school*, for God's sake.

Like Sousuke says, "surprisingly, Chidori Kaname doesn't seem to dislike" him. It is quite surprising, really. But then again, we can see that Kaname is a pretty complex character, and is not easy to read from just a couple of episodes. Kaname and Sousuke clearly have some chemistry already.

The proverbial shit hits the fan pretty quickly in this series; by episode three we have a plane hostage situation, and we finally learn at least a snippet about why people want Kaname so badly. I liked the fast pacing of these episodes, and the way we didn't have to wait an excruciatingly long time for the plot to kick into overdrive. For each episode only having under 20 minutes of proper time to play with, it really needs to pack a lot in each episode.

Now that everything is out in the open, the relationship between the effervescent Kaname and the staunch Sousuke can really begin to develop, but first they have to get out of the Autonomous region of Khanka alive. I wonder if they can... \*rolls eyes\*
