Sorry, I know I'm falling behind on this series, despite it being the only one I'm seriously blogging this season. Episode 5 is out already, but I haven't seen it yet.

Also, someone needs to own up. Who was the one to tell the world to just break *this* time? But really, I guess we should have seen [this](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/8194563.stm) coming. It wasn't as large as the one depicted in TM 8.0, but I guess it will increase viewership. It's like free advertising by mother nature.

There are a couple of things I noticed this episode. Chief among them being that Mirai has exceptional unluckiness. If something bad can happen at any one moment, it will happen to her. And it'll be caused by some *really* annoying person too. What doesn't help is her snotty twelve-year old attitude about everything. It's exasperating watching Mirai go through her routine.

We're again reminded of the horror of the situation when Mirai's unluckiness strikes again and someone stomps on her foot while running past. About to argue, Mirai then realises they're running to a van with some body bags inside.

You may be pissed off, but at least you're not dead.

There isn't much to report this episode, really. Mirai and Yuuki fight a bit, as brother and sister tend to do. Then they drop the bomb. A fricking huge one.

![Goodbye, Tokyo Tower ;_;](/images/blog/2009/08/13/0401.jpg)

First it's the Rainbow Bridge, now this?! Holy crap. Imagine the Eiffel Tower collapsing. [Tokyo Tower](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Tower) is a few feet *taller* than the Eiffel Tower. This is on a massive scale. And Yuuki nearly gets crushed with debris. Again. They're really trying to drive home the point here. You better not be standing around huge towers when the huge earthquake comes knocking.

It's interesting they've decided to do this. Tachu Naito, the designer of the tower, [said](http://search.japantimes.co.jp/member/member.html?fl20020317a1.htm) the tower could "withstand earthquakes with twice the intensity of the Great Kanto Earthquake, a [magnitude] 7.9." It's possible to hand-wave this away by saying that the main earthquake unseated the tower's foundations and the sustained aftershocks were the final blow.

It does make you wonder if bones have erred on the side of "fiction" and "stories" rather than "tremendous amounts of research and verification."
