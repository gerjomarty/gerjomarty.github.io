In this episode of Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 - the production committee decide they haven't deflated us enough with all of the destruction of our national landmarks, and decide that we need to turn the sadness up to eleven.

It just so happens that the next stop on the way home is Mirai's school. When she mentions how it's not even like it's her school anymore, it again really puts you in the shoes of the characters. Everyone subconsciously thinks about a disaster relief centre at their own school. It drives home the point.

The paced character development shows here - Mirai has started acting more like an older sister recently, and her wanting to show Yuuki something cool at her school really makes you smile - 'they're getting on well, aren't they?' You may think. Then...

To make matters worse, we finally meet someone who was introduced pre-quake - Megu. Not only do we feel incredibly sad for her, as she has just lost her mother, we are also made to feel incredibly bad for even feeling a hint of ill will towards her for her earlier snobbish (or what seemed to be snobbish at the time) attitude. It really makes you empathise with Mirai when she says she "can't do anything for her" at all.

Megu neatly sums up what this episode is all about - the personal experiences of those who have been affected by the quake.

The other personal experience we learn about this episode is that of the old couple - the man who is trying to make everyone else feel comfortable, and his wife, who is so shocked about the death of their grandchildren she sees Mirai and Yuuki as them. Her helpless face as more after shocks occur only serves to strengthen the view that she *really* sees Mirai and Yuuki as her grandchildren, making it all the more sad.

When we hear the full story, and the reason why the man is helping - "I want the young to live" - it all becomes too much for Mirai (and me, when I was watching), who wants to help but could never aspire to do that much in her current state.

All in all, a very powerful episode, and much more emotional than falling landmarks could ever be.
