Well, here we are. Our brave young heroine Yoshika is now a member of the 501st, and here's her first proper taste of battle on the frontline of the English Channel.

Most of the episode focuses on the new relationship between Lynette and Yoshika. There isn't really anything new to report on the character side of Yoshika. She's still one of those "I've got to do my best" types with no real deviation from that path yet.

And here we introduce Lynette as the "I'm a burden to everyone" type. As for the res of the Witches, we've only really caught a glimpse so far, but the glimpse doesn't really look promising. We have a suck-up, a lovable little scamp and a few weird ones. Half of the division seems to be fascinated by breasts. But in a lovable way... yeah.

We still see evidence that Yoshika has something of a split moral compass in regards to war. Like refusing to use a pistol, then inexplicably wielding a huge machine gun later on. "Peculiar girl" indeed.

So overall, the aim of the episode was to accelerate Yoshika and Lynette from "-san" status to "-chan" status, really. Apart from that, it wasn't terribly eventful or memorable. This is just the build-up for the series, after all. The next episode doesn't seem like it'll be much more either, just some rivalry building between our heroine and Perrine.
