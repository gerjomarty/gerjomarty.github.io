## Day 1: 2017-04-28 Friday

Fresh off the plane from Helsinki, suddenly we're in Tokyo. Or more accurately, we're in Narita. It's one of those airports that is nowhere near the city it mostly serves. According to Google, it's a cool 66km to Tokyo from there.

You'll be happy to hear though, that "London" Southend Airport just about has it beat, at 68km.

### Sorting out Internet access

The first order of business was to pick up a portable Wi-Fi router from the Post Office. I'd used [CDJapan](https://rental.cdjapan.co.jp/) at the time, but there are plenty of operators out there. At the time, this cost me ¥4340 for 10 days at standard speeds.

I think if you have a phone with a second SIM slot, getting an actual SIM card might be a preferable option rather than having to carry around a portable Wi-Fi hotspot. Other than potentially being pricier and more difficult to obtain, US and European mobile phones are sometimes tailored to the mobile signal bands most prevalent in those areas, which aren't the same bands available in Japan. This can mean potentially slower speeds than a locally procured hotspot, but check your own phone.

These days, E-sims might also be an option if your phone can indeed use frequency bands available in Japan.

### Getting out of the airport

There are other, cheaper ways to get into Tokyo other than the Narita Express, but it is the most hassle-free way.

It's especially useful if you happen to be travelling to a destination on the line past Tokyo station, as the N'EX Round Trip ticket has a flat fare for all destinations while the full price tickets get more expensive the further the distance.

As mentioned, the JR East Travel Service Centre at the airport is able to sell these tickets with reservations, which are required.

The Japan Rail Pass is accepted on these trains (with a reservation also being required), but I wasn't using that ticket this time. The queue to redeem Rail Pass "exchange orders" at the airport was so long I think it would have added an extra hour or more to my journey anyway. Make sure to factor this time in!

My train to Ikebukuro was incredibly empty, and each seat has enough space to hold my large suitcase with plenty of legroom to spare.

Having just come half way around the world, I was a little dismayed to see the news on the train.

### Ikebukuro

I was staying near Ikebukuro, but had most of the afternoon to go out and play, and reading back on it I'm amazed I had the energy to do everything I did after travelling for hours on end.

> Coin lockers are easy and good. The one in Ikebukuro even seemed to do multiple days.
>
> — *My notebook*

Having arrived at the station with a giant suitcase, I was able to put the whole lot in a coin locker at the station and forget about it for the rest of the day, and for only ¥600. It's one of those things that Japan just gets right, and it makes you wonder why the rest of the world can't do this really simple thing well. Left luggage at King's Cross station probably would have cost around 7-8 times more.

First order of business was checking out the limited-time *Kemono Friends* cafe, which just happened to be in the area, and just happened to be on while I was there. Honestly! After taking a ticket and scanning the code, the provided URL gave me a rough time to come back at, negating the need to waste time queueing up.

There's also a Pokemon Centre in Ikebukuro which was very big and very cool, though past me must have been a little jaded, calling it "obviously just a big old shop."

### Akihabara

I couldn't wait to hop over to Akihabara, even despite this being my first day. It's one of those places that feels unreal initially—there are huge billboards, superstores, and street criers for this normally niche interest. I lost count of the number of literaly double takes I did at, well, *everything*.

Yeah, I went to *that* shrine. No, not the war criminal one, the other one. The one that's featured in all the anime.

The passers by probably thought I was crazy for taking a picture of some steps, but scoping out settings from various media properties and then visiting them in person is a legitimate tourist activity now. Right?

A staple of Akiba are the arcades, and I made sure to try to get to a couple of them.

I really made the most of the arcade rhythm game availability today. There's a place in Angel in London called Vega that has a basement full of rhythm games that I hope can weather out the pandemic, as the next nearest place to play these machines really does feel like Akihabara.

> Club Sega is cool.
>
> — *My notebook*

I'm really sorry to report that this particular branch of Club Sega closed in August 2020.

The thing I was really excited to try at Club Sega was the *Love Live! School Idol Festival After School Activity* arcade rhythm game, with it's button configuration mimicking the mobile phone game's semicircular controls. It had also just recently came to arcades, so the initial hype was still strong.

> *LLSIF ASA* is nice. Massive queue for it. They even seem to have a printer gacha. Literally printing money.

> The beatmaps are unfortunately much different, and hard to see (though there is a setting to dim the background) so I did pretty badly. Could easily pour money into this one.

> — *My notebook*

Yeah, really. A sticker printer that would print out cards of varying rarities. They'd even set up a poverty stand where you could leave your filthy R stickers for the plebs like me to enjoy.

> NEVER TRY CRANE GAMES AGAIN

> It will not work without the skills.

This log entry was clearly written in a fit of passion. I think I'd half-heartedly started trying to get a figure from a UFO catcher before realising my folly. Dedication and not worrying about the monetary costs are essential for this endeavour. What really hurt was that others came and finished the job after I gave it up.

Always gacha responsibly.

Tomorrow we leave Tokyo just as quick as we arrived. Where to? The frozen north...
