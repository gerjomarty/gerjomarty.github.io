Putting the knowledge we learned back in the good old days when Tokyo was in one piece to good use now, as we're reintroduced to the all-terrain earthquake robots who search for survivors under the rubble.

We're also introduced to Kento, the robot nerd this episode. Mirai seems to have lots of foot in mouth moments here, especially when Kento tells her his family would be dead without them, accompanied by a token flashback. But Mirai, like you're one to talk about nerds. I mean, frogs? *Really?*

Mirai finally says out loud what she's been thinking this whole time - she's been a bad kid, and always acted contrary in front of her parents, like any average 12 year old. I guess when you don't know if they're alive or dead it kind of puts things in perspective. This Mirai is a very different one from episode one, who just wanted everything to break. She's become a much better person, and it hasn't been a magic character upgrade switch-press either, it's happened very gradually since the earthquake in episode two.

And now that the brother-sister relationship is finally back on track...

There's another spanner in the works. What a cliff-hanger, if you'll excuse the pun (again).
